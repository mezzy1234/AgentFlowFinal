# 🎯 **WHAT TO DO NOW - Step by Step Guide**

## 🚀 **Current Status:**
Your Agent Runtime Management System is **built and ready**! The server is running at `http://localhost:3000` and all the code is complete. You just need to set up the database tables in Supabase.

---

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/axaabtqsoksxrcgndtcq
2. Login to your Supabase account
3. You should see your project dashboard

### **Step 2: Open SQL Editor**
1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New Query"** button
3. You'll see an empty SQL editor

### **Step 3: Copy the Runtime Tables SQL**
1. In your VS Code, open the file: `setup-runtime-tables.sql`
2. Select ALL the content (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy it (Ctrl+C)

### **Step 4: Paste and Execute**
1. Go back to the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Paste the SQL content (Ctrl+V)
3. Click the **"Run"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
4. Wait for it to complete - you should see "Success" messages

### **Step 5: Verify the Tables**
1. In Supabase, go to **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. You should now see these new tables:
   - `organization_runtimes`
   - `agent_memory_pools`
   - `agent_memory_states`
   - `runtime_metrics`
   - `runtime_execution_events`
   - `container_execution_metrics`
   - `container_timeout_events`
   - `container_error_events`

## 🎉 **AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

### **Access Your Runtime Dashboard:**
Visit: **http://localhost:3000/admin/runtime**

### **What You'll See:**
- Real-time system monitoring
- Organization runtime status
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance metrics
- Health indicators

### **Test the System:**
```bash
# Run this in your terminal to test everything
node scripts/test-runtime-architecture.js
```

---

## 🛠️ **Alternative Method (If Dashboard Doesn't Work):**

### **Using Terminal:**
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref axaabtqsoksxrcgndtcq

# Execute the SQL file
supabase db push
```

---

## ❓ **Troubleshooting:**

### **If SQL execution fails:**
- Check if you're logged in to the correct Supabase account
- Make sure you have permissions for the project
- Try running smaller sections of the SQL file

### **If you see "table already exists" errors:**
- That's normal! It means some tables were already created
- The system is designed to handle this gracefully

### **If the dashboard shows no data:**
- That's expected initially - data appears when agents start running
- The system will automatically populate as you use it

---

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS GIVES YOU:**

Once deployed, you'll have:
- **Enterprise-grade agent runtime system**
- **Multi-tenant organization isolation** 
- **Real-time performance monitoring**
- **Resource management and limits**
- **Professional admin dashboard**
- **Production-ready scaling**

---

**Just copy the SQL file content to Supabase SQL Editor and run it - that's it!** 🚀

The entire Agent Runtime Management System will then be fully operational!
